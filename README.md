# 🏛️ MILESHI HORIZON | Sovereign Apex 2.1

**MILESHI HORIZON** is a premium, browser-based management ecosystem designed for luxury hospitality and secure identity tracking. It features a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, persistent data storage, and a high-fidelity "biometric" interface.



## 🚀 Key Features
* **Encapsulated State Engine:** Core logic is wrapped in IIFEs to prevent browser console tampering and variable hijacking.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Distinct permission tiers for **Guests**, **Staff**, and **System Administrators**.
* **Biometric Interface:** Custom CSS animations simulate a high-security biometric scanner during the login sequence.
* **Persistent Inventory:** Real-time tracking of suites, dining, and amenities using `localStorage`.
* **Standardized CSS Architecture:** Fully compliant with modern browser standards, including fixed `background-clip` properties for gold gradients.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for all portals.
* **CSS3:** Custom luxury theme with `-webkit` compatibility and responsive grid layouts.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Encapsulated logic for state management and security overrides.

## 🔐 Administrative Access
To access the command terminal, use the following credentials in the **Admin Portal**:
* **ID:** `ADMIN`
* **PIN:** `SUPER-LOGS`
